# Bank Customer Churn
In this project, I explored and analysed customer performance and activity data from a European bank to uncover churn trends and deliver insights that support better retention strategies using tools including SQL server to query the database for analysis and Power BI to visualize the insights obtained from the analysis.

## Objectives
1. What attributes are more common among churners than non-churners? Can churn be predicted using the variables in the data?
2. What do the overall demographics of the bank's customers look like?
3. Is there a difference between German, French, and Spanish customers in terms of account behavior?
4. What types of segments exist within the bank's customers?

## Findings and Insights
Out of 10,000 customers, 20.4% have churned across the three countries—highlighting a critical need for proactive retention strategies. Notably, 69% of these churned customers used only one product, indicating low engagement with the bank’s broader offerings. This presents a clear opportunity to drive product adoption and improve customer loyalty.

The analysis of the bank's churn data provides valuable insights, particularly when considering the following key factors:

### 1. LOCATION
Germany has a significantly higher churn rate(32%) compared to France and Spain, which are nearly the same(16%). This could suggest that Germany might be facing more challenges in customer retention, and it might be worth exploring the factors contributing to this higher churn rate so that it can be curbed.

### 2. GENDER
The data shows that female customers(56%) consistently have a higher churn rate than male customers across all three countries. This pattern highlights gender-based differences, emphasizing the need for targeted retention strategies for female customers.

### 3. AGE BRACKET
Churn is highest among customers aged 41-50 with a total of 788 out of 2037 customers, possibly due to evolving financial needs or competitive alternatives. Younger customers (18-30) have low churn, possibly due to lower engagement or fewer financial obligations. Churn drops further for those 51+, indicating stronger loyalty and long-term banking relationships.

### 4. ACTIVITY LEVEL
It has been observed that 63% of the customers who churned stopped using the bank's products and services before formally exiting. This suggests that, over time, these customers disengaged due to a general dissatisfaction with the bank's offerings.

### 5. NUMBER OF PRODUCTS USED BY CUSTOMERS BEFORE CHURN
69% of churned customers used only one product, underscoring the need to assess offerings and encourage broader service adoption for better engagement.
